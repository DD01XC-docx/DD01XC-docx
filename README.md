# Hi! I'm Yev 🤖
### About me 🚀
#### I am a novice specialist in cyber security 🕸️. My path began with guides on YouTube and knowledge of what is a network to personal audits of companies, pentest-entrusts and interaction with large SOC, from which I get useful information to this day. I hope we work out, and everyone who harshly hacks the systems will be punished by law =).
