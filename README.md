# Hi! I'm Yev 🤖
### About Me 🚀
#### I am a novice specialist in cyber security 🕸️. My path began with guides on YouTube and learning about networks, followed by personal audits of companies, pentest-entrusts, and interaction with large SOCs, from which I continue to gain useful information. I hope we work together well, and that those who harshly hack systems are punished by law =).
### What I Do 🎯
🔍 Penetration Testing – Identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting weaknesses, and strengthening security.

🔬 Malware Analysis – Examining malicious software behavior and identifying threats.

🖥 Reverse Engineering – Decompiling binaries and analyzing software for security flaws.

📡 Network Security – Monitoring traffic, detecting anomalies, and securing network infrastructures.

🕵️‍♂️ Digital Forensics – Investigating cyber incidents, analyzing disk images, and extracting evidence.

🛡 Incident Response – Understanding cyber threats, responding to attacks, and mitigating risks.
