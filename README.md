# Hi! I'm Yev 🤖
### About me 🚀
#### I am a novice specialist in cyber security 🕸️. My path began with guides on YouTube and learning about networks, followed by personal audits of companies, pentest-entrusts, and interaction with large SOCs, from which I continue to gain useful information. I hope we work together well, and that those who harshly hack systems are punished by law =).
